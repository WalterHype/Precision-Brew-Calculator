Welcome to the official repository for the Precision Brew Calculator, a standalone desktop application designed for the serious homebrewer who demands accuracy and reliability. This tool was built to be more precise, transparent, and powerful than any web-based calculator available.

Our Philosophy: Trust Through Transparency
We understand that downloading and running an executable file requires trust. In a community built on shared knowledge, you deserve to know exactly what's running on your machine. That's why this project is built on a foundation of complete transparency.

100% Open Source
This project is fully open source. Every line of code—from the user interface to the calculation algorithms—is available for you to inspect, audit, and verify. We have nothing to hide.

Verifiable and Secure Downloads
Every official release is packaged with two layers of security:

SHA-256 Checksum: We provide a unique digital fingerprint for every .exe file. You can run a simple command on your own computer to verify that the file you downloaded has not been altered or corrupted in any way.

VirusTotal Analysis: Each release is scanned by VirusTotal, a service that uses over 70 different antivirus engines to check for malware. We provide a public link to the report for every version so you can see the results for yourself.

Key Features
Runs Locally on Your PC
No internet connection required. The calculator runs directly on your desktop, making it fast, reliable, and always available when you need it.

High-Precision Calculations
The calculation engine was designed from the ground up for accuracy. It uses a comprehensive database of specific densities and displacement values for a wide range of powders, carrier oils, and solvents.

Adjust for Real-World Purity
Don't have 100% pure powder? No problem. The calculator allows you to input your raw material's purity percentage and instantly adjusts the entire recipe to compensate.

Account for Filter Loss
Stop guessing how much solution you're losing in your filter. You can select your exact filter type and size, and the calculator will automatically subtract the known "hold-up volume" from the carrier oil for a more accurate final yield.

Downloadable PDF Recipes
Save, print, and archive your recipes with a single click. Every calculation can be instantly exported to a clean, professional PDF document for your records.

Intuitive Visuals
Understand your recipe's composition at a glance with a dynamic chart that visualizes the volume percentage of each ingredient in your final solution.

Getting Started
You can download the latest version of the Precision Brew Calculator from the official Releases Page.

Each release includes the .exe installer, its SHA-256 checksum, and a link to its public VirusTotal report.
